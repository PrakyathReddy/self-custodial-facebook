# self-custodial-facebook

In this program, I built a "self-custodial facebook" where induviduals may publish information about themselves that other users can find out about, such as their name, status, abilities and one joke.

Instructions

- here we create a new account for each user using PDAs
- every 'facebook_account' is a PDA with seeds that includes their 'WALLET_ADDRESS' and 'CONSTANT_PREFIX'
- the 'update_status' instrcution allows user to update their status
- the third instruction will allow users to close their account
